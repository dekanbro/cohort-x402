This folder is intended to contain RaidGuild brand fonts used by the site.

Recommended files (from https://github.com/raid-guild/brand/tree/main/public/fonts):

- MAZIUSREVIEW20.09-Regular.woff
- EBGaramond-VariableFont_wght.ttf
- EBGaramond-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf
- UbuntuMono-Regular.woff2

You can run the helper script at `scripts/fetch-raidguild-fonts.sh` to download these files from the RaidGuild GitHub repo (requires network access and curl or wget). If your environment blocks outbound requests, please download these files manually and place them here.

After adding fonts, restart the dev server.
