# **RaidGuild x402 Facilitator**

### *The easiest way to add pay-per-use monetization to any API.*

---

## **💀 What Is This?**

The RaidGuild x402 Facilitator is a **developer-friendly micro-payment gateway** that lets you charge tiny amounts of USDC for API requests — no signup, no KYC, no complicated setup.

Drop it in front of any backend → your API becomes a **toll gate**.

* Perfect for agents
* Perfect for AI workloads
* Perfect for indie devs
* Perfect for teams who want simple metering without centralized overhead

This is **open, permissionless, and powered by Base.**

---

## **⚔️ Why We Built It**

Most x402 facilitators today are:

* centralized
* require accounts
* require KYC
* or force developers into a platform ecosystem

That kills experimentation and slows down the emerging **agentic economy**.

RaidGuild is fixing that.

We’re offering an **open, community-aligned facilitator** that developers can use immediately — while showcasing the craft and culture RG is known for.

This is public infrastructure with **RaidGuild energy**.

## **🔥 What You Can Do With It**

### **1. Charge micropayments for your API**

Set prices as low as **$0.0001 per request**.
Perfect for:

* AI inference
* data lookups
* on-chain calls
* automation triggers
* usage-based SaaS
* agent services

### **2. Issue temporary API keys instantly**

Our built-in key generator lets devs:

* connect a wallet (or just provide an address),
* get a short-lived key,
* start testing immediately.

No accounts. No friction.

### **3. Build & demo faster**

Perfect for:

* hackathons
* cohort demos
* prototypes
* internal RaidGuild raids
* workshops or tech talks

If your project needs a “paid endpoint,” this gives it to you in minutes.

### **4. Onboard builders into the RaidGuild ecosystem**

Every developer who touches the facilitator:

* sees the RaidGuild brand,
* reads our docs,
* enters our orbit.

It doubles as a **business development funnel** for RG services.
